Rails app generated with 

This project is a clone of [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates) with Devise gem.

I simply added Devise Auth Token gem and made the configuration for the User model on the route on /api/v1

This backend contains a simple Appointment model with a string title field and a text body field with a controller accessible via the API.

This project serves as an example backend for the connection of a react-native application available [here](https://github.com/Eth3rnit3/React-native-app-to-rails-backend#configuring-packager-ip-address)

basically

````
bundle install
rails db:setup

````
